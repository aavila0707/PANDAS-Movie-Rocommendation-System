# The Power of Pandas: Movie Recommendation System

## What does this project do?
The objective of this proyect is to create a program that will recommend films to a user. The recommendations will be based on how this user has rated other films. This type of models are used by popular apps such as Netflix or Spotify to recommend films and artists in their platforms.

## What libraries does it use? 
In this project I use Pandas to read the data frames and also to manipulate the data and find the most relevant films to recommend to a specific user, based on the films they already like. I also use Seaborn and Matplotlib for EDA. 

## How are the recommendations obtained?
This project does not use machine learning to get the recommendations. It uses only the power of the Pandas library to manipulate the data and get the correlation of other films to a given film once we have their ratings. This project is a very good exercise to learn the power of the Pandas library and its correlation functions.
